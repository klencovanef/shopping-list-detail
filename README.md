Shopping List â€“ Detail Page

This project was created as my homework for the course Frontend Systems.  
The goal of this task was to build a page that shows the detail of one shopping list.  
The design and structure are based on my previous homework.

I wanted to learn how to work with React components, state management, and how to create a simple but clear user interface.



Main Functions

- Change the name of the shopping list (only the owner can do this)
- Add, delete and mark items as bought
- Filter items: Active / Bought / All
- Manage members:
  - The owner can add or remove members  
  - Members can leave the list themselves
- All data is stored only in local state (it resets after page reload)



Technologies Used

- React (Create React App)
- React Hooks: useState, useMemo  
- React Icons for small visuals and buttons  
- Custom CSS for layout and styles

- Build Information

The project build was created using the command:

npm run build

The result of the build process is located in the /build folder.
According to the assignment requirements, this folder has been zipped
and included as shopping-list-detail-build.zip for submission.
